## Overview

Spotr is intended to be used by a customer to find different fitness facilities based on their location, desired activity, and general category of exercise. Facility owners are also able to utilize our application to advertise and have customers view and potentially join their gym or facility.

## Description

This full stack web application utilizes a fully developed mySQL database schema connected to Java through JPA.


Our friend C.R.U.D, this time manipulating objects and saving them in an appropriate database table.

A user log in, which is authenticated by a mySQL table. There should be different permission levels for the users, one admin that can add/update/delete content present on the site.

A correct implementation of a session object, this can be used to track a logged in user and any changes they make (for example, a shopping cart or favorites list).

A way to track an individual user's previous experiences on the site. For example if it is a food ordering system, a list of previous orders.
